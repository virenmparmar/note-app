# Serverless Shopping List on AWS

This is an example of simple CRUD operations with a serverless architecture. 

The following operations are permitted on the shopping list. 

- Add item to list

- Get all the items in the shopping list

- Update an item in the list

- Deleting the item from the list

I have used API Gateway - Lambda - DynamoDB for the backend architecture. 
The CI/CD is implemented using Github actions. 

Various online resources were referred for the development and learning purpose.
